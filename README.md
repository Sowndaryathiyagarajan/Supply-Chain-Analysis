# Supply Chain Analysis with Python

## Introduction

The supply chain is a complex network encompassing production and logistics, all aimed at efficiently producing and delivering goods to customers. **Supply Chain Analysis** involves dissecting various components of this network to uncover insights and identify opportunities for enhancing its effectiveness and, ultimately, creating more value for customers. If you're keen to learn how to analyze a supply chain, you've come to the right place. This article will guide you through the process of Supply Chain Analysis using Python.

## Supply Chain Analysis: Dataset

To analyze a company's supply chain, you'll need relevant data spanning different stages of the supply chain process. This includes data related to sourcing, manufacturing, transportation, inventory management, sales, and customer demographics.

For this analysis, we have an ideal dataset available, which provides insights into the supply chain of a Fashion and Beauty startup. You can download the dataset [here](#insert-link).

In the following sections, we'll delve into the process of Supply Chain Analysis using the Python programming language.

## Getting Started

To begin your journey into analyzing the supply chain, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this GitHub repository to access the project files and code.
2. **Install Python and Libraries**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You'll need libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and others. You can install them using pip:

   ```shell
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
